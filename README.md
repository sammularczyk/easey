Adds a speed graph, simple value graph and allows cubic-bezier notation for easing between two keyframes. Makes easing easy. 

You can also save presets, and copy duration and easing values to pass to developers.

If you're looking for a more polished value graph editor that supports Magic Easing, check out [Curves at Scenery.io](https://scenery.io/scripts/curves-42xvUYqCpvY).

> Hold CTRL/CMD while dragging handles to mirror them in the Speed graph.
